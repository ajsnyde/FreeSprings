# FreeSprings

The goal of this project is to create and store free (as in beer) underwater cave maps. While I'm developing a new method to survey caves more quickly and accurately using SLAM and LiDAR, this repo is open for all cave surveys and contributions so long as they are free.

## Guidelines and Rules:
- Cave diving is inherently dangerous, and requires proper training! No encouraging dangerous practices. Be safe!
- Maps should try to be agnostic supplements, not guides.
- No licensed data/maps. All contributions should be free, no strings attached.
- All data should be provided in raw format in addition to the processed end-product. If 182 measurements were taken to make a hand-drawn map, add them! Ideally documentation should exist to reproduce maps using the base data.
